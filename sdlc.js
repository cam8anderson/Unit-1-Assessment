// In this section you will answer some work through problems related to the Software Development Lifecycle

//////////////////PROBLEM 1////////////////////
/*
    Reorganize the following steps of the Software Development Lifecycle to be in their correct order.
*/

// Planning
// Analysis of Requirements
// Design
// Implementation
// Testing & Integration
// Maintain

//////////////////PROBLEM 2////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable for each of the above steps of the Software Development Lifecycle and set the values of each variable to a definition of the step.
    The first one is done for you.

const planning =
  "This is the first step, in which the end goal of the software is determined and defined. Developers typically will see what systems are already in place, and determine what features will need to be added.";

const Analysis =
  "In this step, you make a requirement specifications document that is used as a guideline for the next step.";

const Design =
  "This is where the system and software is designed and was based on the requirement specifications document from step 2. helps specify hardware and system requirements. They also come up with a test strategy on what and how to test.";

const Implementation =
  "This is the longest part of the lifecycle where you actually code because you have completed the system design.";

const Testing =
  "Once you are done writing the code you test it to see if it's doing what you wanted it to do.";

const Maintain =
  "You have now tested it people are going to find problems and you will solve them as they come up, you maintain the product.";
